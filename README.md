## Introduction

Expand on the initial introduction. What was the specific task within BirdCLEF you addressed? What makes this problem interesting or challenging? Briefly state your overall approach. Mention that the code and experiments are primarily presented in Jupyter Notebooks for clarity and step-by-step execution.

## Competition Overview

* **Competition Name:** BirdCLEF [Year] - LifeCLEF Bird Identification Task
* **Organizer:** [e.g., CLEF Initiative, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Xeno-canto]
* **Objective:** Briefly describe the main goal as stated by the organizers (e.g., identify bird species from audio recordings, estimate species presence in soundscapes).
* **Evaluation Metric:** Specify the metric used for ranking (e.g., Mean Average Precision (mAP), F1-score, CMAP).
* **Link to Competition:** [Provide the official competition link (e.g., Kaggle, ImageCLEF website)]

---

## Dataset üíæ

* **Dataset Name:** BirdCLEF [Year] Official Dataset
* **Source:** [e.g., Xeno-canto, Macaulay Library]
* **Description:**
    * Total size of the training/test data.
    * Number of bird species.
    * Duration of audio clips (e.g., variable length, 5-second segments).
    * Audio format (e.g., .ogg, .wav, .mp3).
    * Sampling rate.
    * Any specific characteristics (e.g., noisy environments, overlapping calls, primary vs. secondary labels).
* **Data Access:** Explain how to obtain the data (e.g., download link from the competition page, any required registration). *Do not include the data directly in your repository if it's against competition rules or too large.*
* **External Data (if used):** Clearly state if you used any external datasets, their sources, and how they were incorporated.

## Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

This is the core section detailing your solution. You can either summarize the methodology here and point to specific notebooks for details, or detail it directly.

### Data Preprocessing

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` (or your chosen descriptive name)
* **Summary:** Describe audio loading, resampling, feature extraction (spectrograms like Mel, STFT, CQT with parameters), data augmentation techniques, handling class imbalance, and your train/validation split strategy.

### Model Architecture

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/02_model_definition.ipynb` (or where the model is primarily defined/used)
* **Summary:** Specify base models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, PANNs), pre-trained weights, modifications, input/output shapes. A textual description or a link to a cell in the notebook showing the model summary would be good.

### Training

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb`
* **Summary:** Detail the framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow), optimizer, loss function, batch size, epochs, learning rate schedule, and regularization techniques.

### Post-processing/Ensemble (if any)

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/04_prediction_and_submission.ipynb` (or a dedicated ensemble notebook)
* **Summary:** Explain thresholding strategies, ensembling methods if used, and how predictions for long audio files were handled.

## Results üìä

Present your key findings and performance. You can include screenshots of relevant plots from your notebooks or summarize the key metrics.

### Validation Performance

* Reference the notebook where validation results are calculated (e.g., `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb` or a separate `notebooks/05_evaluation.ipynb`).
* Show your best model's performance on your local validation set using the competition metric.
* Include other relevant metrics or visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices).

### Competition Score (Public/Private LB)

* **Public Leaderboard Score:** [Your score] (Rank: [Your rank])
* **Private Leaderboard Score:** [Your score] (Rank: [Your rank])
* Link to your Kaggle submission or team profile if desired.
