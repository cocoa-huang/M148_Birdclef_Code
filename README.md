## Introduction

This repository documents our project for the **BirdCLEF 2025 competition**. The primary goal is to identify bird species from continuous audio recordings, a challenging multi-label classification task. Our entire workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and submission generation, is presented through a series of Jupyter Notebooks for clarity and reproducibility. We aim to develop an efficient model for diverse acoustic environments.

## Competition Overview

* **Competition Name:** BirdCLEF 2025
* **Organizer:** LifeCLEF in partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Macaulay Library, and xeno-canto.
* **Objective:** To develop a system that can process continuous audio recordings from various locations and automatically provide a multi-label list of bird species present in each recording.
* **Evaluation Metric:** macro-averaged ROC-AUC
* **Link to Competition:** [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025/overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025/overview)

## Dataset üíæ

* **Dataset Name:** BirdCLEF 2025 Official Dataset
* **Source:** Data is primarily sourced from [xeno-canto.org](https://xeno-canto.org/) and the [Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/).
* **Description:**
    * The training data consists of a collection of audio recordings, each labeled with the bird species present.
    * Recordings come from diverse geographical locations and environments, leading to a wide range of acoustic conditions and background noise levels.
    * Recordings can contain multiple bird species (multi-label).
    * The test data will consist of continuous audio recordings (soundscapes).
    * Specific details on the number of species, recording lengths, and audio formats will be provided with the data release by the competition organizers.
* **Data Access:** Explain how to obtain the data (e.g., download link from the competition page, any required registration). *Do not include the data directly in your repository if it's against competition rules or too large.*
* **External Data (if used):** Clearly state if you used any external datasets, their sources, and how they were incorporated, ensuring compliance with competition rules.

## Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

This is the core section detailing your solution. You can either summarize the methodology here and point to specific notebooks for details, or detail it directly.

### Data Preprocessing

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` (or your chosen descriptive name)
* **Summary:** Describe audio loading, resampling, feature extraction (spectrograms like Mel, STFT, CQT with parameters), data augmentation techniques, handling class imbalance, and your train/validation split strategy.

### Model Architecture

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/02_model_definition.ipynb` (or where the model is primarily defined/used)
* **Summary:** Specify base models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, PANNs), pre-trained weights, modifications, input/output shapes. A textual description or a link to a cell in the notebook showing the model summary would be good.

### Training

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb`
* **Summary:** Detail the framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow), optimizer, loss function, batch size, epochs, learning rate schedule, and regularization techniques.

### Post-processing/Ensemble (if any)

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/04_prediction_and_submission.ipynb` (or a dedicated ensemble notebook)
* **Summary:** Explain thresholding strategies, ensembling methods if used, and how predictions for long audio files were handled.

## Results üìä

Present your key findings and performance. You can include screenshots of relevant plots from your notebooks or summarize the key metrics.

### Validation Performance

* Reference the notebook where validation results are calculated (e.g., `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb` or a separate `notebooks/05_evaluation.ipynb`).
* Show your best model's performance on your local validation set using the competition metric.
* Include other relevant metrics or visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices).

### Competition Score (Public/Private LB)

* **Public Leaderboard Score:** [Your score] (Rank: [Your rank])
* **Private Leaderboard Score:** [Your score] (Rank: [Your rank])
* Link to your Kaggle submission or team profile if desired.
